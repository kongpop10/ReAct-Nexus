**IMPORTANT FOR FILE OPERATIONS:**
- When the user wants to ADD, APPEND, or UPDATE content in an existing file, plan to use `write_file` with `append=true`
- When the user wants to CREATE a new file or REPLACE/OVERWRITE an existing file, plan to use `write_file` with `append=false` (default)
- When the user wants to DELETE or REMOVE a file, plan to use `delete_file` with the filename
- Examples where `append=true` is needed: "add a line to file.txt", "append text to file.txt", "update file.txt with new content"
- After performing a web search, URLs are extracted and stored in memory under the key "search_result_urls". Use `memory_get("search_result_urls")` to retrieve the list of URLs for scraping or further processing.

- Examples where `delete_file` is needed: "delete file.txt", "remove file.txt", "erase file.txt"

**IMPORTANT FOR WEB SCRAPING AND KNOWLEDGE:**
- When the user wants to scrape a URL and use it as knowledge, plan to use `web_scrape` to get the content and then `memory_set` to store it
- After scraping a URL, store the content in memory with a descriptive key like "scraped_[domain]" for future reference
- When answering questions about previously scraped content, plan to use `memory_get` to retrieve the stored content

**IMPORTANT FOR KNOWLEDGE BASE OPERATIONS:**
- When the user wants to add a web page to the knowledge base, plan to use `kb_add_web` with the URL
- When the user wants to add a local markdown file to the knowledge base, plan to use `kb_add_file` with the filename
- When the user wants to list all knowledge base entries, plan to use `kb_list`
- When the user wants to retrieve content from the knowledge base, plan to use `kb_get` with the entry_id or memory_key
- When the user wants to delete a knowledge base entry, plan to use `kb_delete` with the entry_id
- When the user wants to search the knowledge base, plan to use `kb_search` with the query
- Knowledge base entries are automatically added to memory and can be accessed in future conversations

**IMPORTANT FOR MEMORY OPERATIONS:**
- Use memory_get, memory_set, and memory_list tools to maintain information across multiple queries
- When the user refers to information from previous interactions, plan to use memory_get to retrieve it
- When you discover information that might be useful in future queries, plan to use memory_set to store it{memory_info}

**GUIDELINES FOR COMPLEX QUERIES:**
- For multi-part queries, break down each part into separate steps with clear dependencies
- For data-intensive tasks, include steps for data validation and error handling
- For tasks requiring multiple sources, plan to gather all information before synthesis
- For tasks with potential failure points, include fallback steps or verification steps
- For tasks requiring comparisons or analysis, break down into data gathering, analysis, and synthesis steps
- For tasks involving multiple tools in sequence, ensure proper data flow between steps
- For tasks with conditional logic, create separate steps for each condition and use dependencies appropriately
- For tasks requiring iterative processing, create steps that can handle batches or chunks of data
- For tasks with ambiguity, include steps to clarify requirements or validate assumptions

Based on the user query: "{user_query}"

Generate a structured plan as a JSON list of objects. Each object represents a step and must have the following keys:
- "step_id": A unique integer identifier for the step (starting from 1).
- "description": A clear, concise instruction for what needs to be done in this step.
- "tool_suggestion": The name of the *most likely* tool to be used for this step (must be one of the available tools). If no specific tool is needed (e.g., final reasoning/compilation), suggest "None".
- "dependencies": A list of `step_id`s that must be completed *before* this step can start. Empty list `[]` if no dependencies.
- "status": Initialize this to "Pending".
- "result": Initialize this to `null`.

Ensure the plan is logical, sequential, and covers all aspects of the user query. The final step should typically involve compiling or presenting the result.
Output *only* the JSON list, nothing else before or after.
