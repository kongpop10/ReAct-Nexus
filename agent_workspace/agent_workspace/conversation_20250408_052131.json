Introduction\n\nThis technical report provides an analysis of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller options based on commercially available Integrated Circuits (ICs). The report focuses on identifying suitable PWM controllers that meet specific criteria, including complementary outputs, integrated dead-time control, switching frequencies exceeding 200kHz, and potential for enable/modulation capabilities.  This analysis is based on information gathered and synthesized from available resources, aiming to guide the selection process for PWM controllers in various applications.\n\n## 2. PWM Controller Options\n\nThis report examines three primary categories of PWM controller ICs, each offering distinct features and capabilities:\n\n### 2.1. Microchip MIC3808/3809 Push-Pull PWM Controllers\n\nThe Microchip MIC3808 and MIC3809 are identified as complementary output push-pull PWM control ICs. These controllers are designed for high-speed applications, making them suitable for telecom and similar demanding environments.  A key feature is their integrated and adjustable dead-time control, ranging from 60ns to 200ns, which is crucial for efficient operation and preventing shoot-through in push-pull configurations.\n\n### 2.2. Texas Instruments TL594 Pulse-Width-Modulation Control Circuit\n\nThe Texas Instruments TL594 is a versatile and widely recognized PWM control circuit. It offers uncommitted output transistors, providing flexibility to configure outputs for common-emitter or emitter-follower configurations, enabling the creation of complementary outputs.  The TL594 also incorporates an on-chip dead-time control comparator, allowing for adjustable dead-time to optimize performance and efficiency.  Its on-chip adjustable oscillator provides frequency control, making it adaptable to various application requirements.\n\n### 2.3. Texas Instruments Automotive PWM Controllers (UCC Series)\n\nTexas Instruments offers a range of automotive-qualified PWM controllers under the UCC series, including UCC28C51-Q1, UCC2813-5-Q1, and UCC2803-Q1. These controllers are designed for robust performance and reliability, often required in automotive applications.  Specific models like UCC2813-5-Q1 and UCC2803-Q1 are highlighted as 1MHz current mode PWM controllers, indicating their capability for high-frequency operation.  These controllers often include Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) thresholds, which can be utilized for enable/disable functionality.\n\n## 3. Technical Specifications and Feature Comparison\n\nThe following table summarizes the key technical specifications and features of the analyzed PWM controller options, based on the available information:\n\n| Feature                      | MIC3808/3809         | TL594                   | UCC28C51-Q1, UCC2813-5-Q1, UCC2803-Q1          |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Output Configuration**       | Complementary Push-Pull | Configurable Complementary | Potentially Complementary (Datasheet needed)  |\n| **Dead-Time Control**        | Integrated, Adjustable (60ns-200ns) | Integrated, Adjustable      | Likely Integrated (Datasheet needed)          |\n| **Switching Frequency**      | > 200kHz (Likely High) | > 200kHz (Likely)       | > 200kHz, Up to 1MHz (Specific models)       |\n| **Enable/Modulation**        | Potentially (Datasheet needed) | Potentially (Datasheet needed) | UVLO (Enable Implied), Modulation potential (Datasheet needed) |\n| **Target Applications**      | Telecom, High-Speed    | General Purpose         | Automotive, High-Frequency Power Conversion   |\n| **Package Type**             | IC                   | IC                      | IC                                            |\n| **Module Availability**      | No                   | No                      | No                                            |\n| **Manufacturer**             | Microchip            | Texas Instruments       | Texas Instruments                               |\n| **Commercial Availability**  | Likely               | Likely                  | Likely                                        |\n\n**Key Insights from the Comparison:**\n\n* **Complementary Outputs:** Both MIC3808/3809 and TL594 explicitly offer or can be configured for complementary outputs, essential for push-pull or bridge configurations. The UCC series likely supports this, but datasheet verification is recommended.\n* **Integrated Dead-Time:** All options appear to offer integrated dead-time control, a critical feature for efficiency and preventing device damage in power switching applications. The MIC3808/3809 specifies an adjustable range, while the TL594 and UCC series require datasheet review for detailed specifications.\n* **Switching Frequency:** All options are likely capable of exceeding 200kHz. The UCC series, particularly UCC2813-5-Q1 and UCC2803-Q1, are explicitly mentioned as 1MHz controllers, making them suitable for high-frequency applications where smaller passive components are desired.\n* **Enable/Modulation:**  Enable/disable functionality is important for power management and protection. While not explicitly detailed in the initial information for all controllers, the TL594 and UCC series suggest potential for control and modulation. The UCC series' UVLO feature inherently provides an enable/disable mechanism based on input voltage.  Datasheet review is crucial to understand the modulation capabilities and specific enable/disable implementations for each controller.\n* **Module vs. IC:**  It is important to note that all analyzed options are discrete ICs, not plug-and-play modules. Implementing these controllers requires circuit design and integration of external components. If a module-based solution is preferred, further targeted searches for modules incorporating these or similar ICs would be necessary.\n\n## 4. Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nBased on this analysis, the **Microchip MIC3808/3809** and **Texas Instruments TL594** stand out as strong candidates for PWM controller selections, particularly due to their explicit mention of complementary outputs and integrated dead-time control. The **Texas Instruments UCC series**, especially the high-frequency models, also presents a viable option, particularly for applications requiring higher switching frequencies and automotive-grade reliability.\n\n**Recommendations for Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Datasheet Verification:**  The most crucial next step is to **download and thoroughly review the datasheets** for each of the identified ICs (MIC3808/3809, TL594, UCC28C51-Q1, UCC2813-5-Q1, UCC2803-Q1).

To determine the availability of evaluation boards for these ICs, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1. **Directly Check Texas Instruments Website:** The most reliable source for information on TI evaluation boards is the official Texas Instruments website (www.ti.com). Search for each IC part number (TL594, UCC28C51-Q1, UCC2813-5-Q1, UCC2803-Q1) on the TI website. Product pages for these ICs will typically list available evaluation modules (EVMs) or development kits, if they exist.\n2. **Utilize TI's Evaluation Board Search Tools:** TI often provides dedicated tools or sections on their website to search for evaluation boards based on product category or part number. Explore the \"Tools & Software\" or \"Evaluation Boards\" sections of the TI website.\n3. **Contact TI Sales or Support:** If online resources are unclear, contacting TI's sales or technical support channels is advisable. They can provide definitive information on evaluation board availability and ordering details.\n4. **Check Distributor Websites:** Authorized distributors like Digi-Key, Mouser, and Arrow often list evaluation boards and development kits alongside the ICs they distribute. Searching for the IC part numbers on these distributor websites may reveal available evaluation boards.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nEvaluation boards are indeed a valuable asset for prototyping and testing, and we've confirmed the availability of a detailed evaluation board for the Microchip MIC3808/3809. For the Texas Instruments ICs (TL594, UCC28C51-Q1, UCC2813-5-Q1, and UCC2803-Q1), further targeted investigation on the Texas Instruments website and through their distribution network is necessary to determine the availability of corresponding evaluation boards.  Utilizing evaluation boards, where available, will undoubtedly expedite the validation process and reduce the time to market for designs incorporating these PWM controllers.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- [MIC3809 Evaluation Board PDF Documentation] (https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/mic3809_eb.pdf)\n- [MIC3809 Product Page | Microchip Technology] (https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/MIC3809)\n- [Evaluation Boards | Microchip Technology] (https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/evaluation-boards)"
