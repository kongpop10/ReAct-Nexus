      "content": "Based on the comprehensive search efforts outlined in the execution results, it appears that **no readily available, plug-and-play PWM controller modules or discrete ICs perfectly match *all* the specified criteria** of complementary outputs, integrated dead-time control, switching frequency exceeding 200kHz per output, and an enable/disable input or 20kHz modulation capability.\n\nThe searches performed in both the knowledge base and the wider web, specifically targeting \"plug-and-play modules\" and \"commercial availability,\" did not yield any direct hits meeting this specific combination of features. This suggests that finding a single, off-the-shelf solution encompassing all these requirements might be challenging.\n\n**Analysis of the Search Outcome and Potential Reasons for Lack of Direct Matches:**\n\n* **Specificity of Requirements:** The combination of all four features (complementary outputs, dead-time, high frequency, and modulation/enable) within a single, readily available component might be somewhat niche. While individual features are common in PWM controllers, their simultaneous presence with the specified performance levels might be less frequently implemented in standard, easily accessible modules.\n* **Frequency and Modulation Trade-offs:** Achieving a switching frequency exceeding 200kHz per output, especially with complementary outputs and dead-time control, often involves trade-offs in terms of IC complexity, power consumption, and potentially modulation capabilities.  Implementing a clean 20kHz modulation on top of a high-frequency PWM might require specialized control architectures that are not always standard features in general-purpose PWM controllers.\n* **\"Plug-and-Play\" Preference:** The preference for plug-and-play modules further narrows down the search space.  Many high-performance PWM controllers are offered as discrete ICs, requiring external components and circuit design for implementation. Plug-and-play modules, while offering convenience, might not always cater to highly specific or demanding performance requirements like high frequency and precise modulation.\n* **Search Limitations:** While the search was conducted using relevant keywords, it's possible that components exist but are described using slightly different terminology or are categorized in ways that were not directly captured by the search queries.  Datasheets and manufacturer websites might contain relevant information that is not immediately apparent in broader product listings.\n\n**Recommendations and Alternative Approaches:**\n\nDespite the lack of direct matches, here are some recommendations and alternative approaches to consider to achieve your desired PWM control functionality:\n\n1. **Re-evaluate \"Plug-and-Play\" Preference:** If the \"plug-and-play\" requirement is flexible, exploring discrete PWM controller ICs becomes crucial. Many ICs offer the desired features individually, and a solution can be built by combining a suitable IC with necessary external components.  This might involve a slightly more complex design process but could provide access to a wider range of high-performance PWM controllers.\n\n2. **Focus on Discrete PWM Controller ICs and Design a Module:**  Instead of searching for a pre-built module, consider identifying suitable discrete PWM controller ICs that meet the technical specifications (complementary outputs, dead-time, >200kHz, enable/modulation).  Then, design a custom module around the chosen IC. This allows for tailoring the solution precisely to your needs and potentially achieving better performance compared to generic modules.\n\n3. **Explore Specific PWM Controller Families/Manufacturers:**  Research manufacturers known for high-performance PWM controllers, particularly those specializing in motor control, power electronics, or lighting applications.  Datasheets and application notes from these manufacturers might reveal ICs that come close to meeting your requirements, even if not explicitly marketed as \"plug-and-play modules.\" Examples of manufacturers to investigate include:\n    * **Texas Instruments (TI):**  TI offers a wide range of PWM controllers, including those for motor control and power supplies, some of which might have high-frequency capabilities and complementary outputs.\n    * **Analog Devices (ADI):** ADI also provides PWM controllers with advanced features, often focusing on precision and high performance.\n    * **Infineon:** Infineon is a major player in power semiconductors and motor control, offering PWM controllers suitable for demanding applications.\n    * **Microchip Technology:** Microchip offers a variety of microcontrollers with integrated PWM peripherals and dedicated PWM controller ICs.\n\n4. **Consider Microcontroller-Based PWM Generation:**  Many modern microcontrollers (especially those designed for motor control or digital signal processing) have advanced PWM peripherals that can be configured to generate complementary outputs with dead-time control at frequencies exceeding 200kHz.  While this is not a \"plug-and-play module\" in the strictest sense, development boards and microcontroller ecosystems can offer a relatively rapid prototyping and implementation path.  You could then implement the 20kHz modulation in software or using another timer/PWM module within the microcontroller.\n\n5. **Compromise on Modulation Method:** If a direct \"enable/disable input\" or modulation with a 20kHz clock is not strictly necessary, explore PWM controllers that offer other forms of duty cycle control or frequency adjustment.  Perhaps a voltage control input or a digital interface (like SPI or I2C) could be used to achieve a similar effect, even if not a direct 20kHz modulation.\n\n6. **Loosen Frequency Requirement (If Possible):** If the 200kHz+ frequency is not absolutely critical, slightly lowering the frequency requirement might broaden the range of available components.  PWM controllers operating in the 100-200kHz range are more common and might offer a better chance of finding a plug-and-play module or readily available IC.\n\n**In conclusion, while a direct, off-the-shelf solution perfectly matching all your specified criteria appears to be unavailable based on the conducted searches, exploring discrete ICs, microcontroller-based solutions, and potentially adjusting some specifications are viable paths forward.  Further investigation into datasheets of PWM controller ICs from reputable manufacturers is highly recommended to identify components that come closest to meeting your needs and to potentially design a custom module if necessary.**\n\n**Sources:**\n- No external sources were used.

      "content": "The query \"find the solution on the internet\" is inherently broad and lacks specific context.  Based on the provided search results, it appears the internet search focused on solutions related to **generating Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, specifically complementary PWM with dead-time, often used in power electronics and motor control applications.**\n\nThe search results highlight two primary approaches:\n\n1. **Using STM32 Microcontrollers with Advanced Timers:** This is presented as a flexible and integrated solution leveraging the built-in capabilities of STM32 microcontrollers.\n2. **Using Dedicated PWM Controller ICs (like MAX5068):** This offers a more specialized hardware approach, often for high-frequency and high-performance applications.\n\nLet's synthesize a comprehensive solution based on these findings:\n\n**Solution: Generating Complementary PWM Signals with Dead-Time**\n\nFor applications requiring complementary PWM signals with dead-time, such as MOSFET gate drivers, DC-DC converters, and motor control, the internet offers several viable solutions.  The most prominent and versatile solutions revolve around using microcontrollers with advanced timer peripherals or dedicated PWM controller ICs.\n\n**1. Microcontroller-Based Solution (STM32 Example):**\n\n* **STM32 Microcontrollers with Advanced Timers:**  STM32 MCUs, particularly those with \"Advanced-Control Timers\" (like TIM1, TIM8, etc.), are well-suited for generating sophisticated PWM waveforms.  These timers offer dedicated features for:\n    * **Complementary PWM Output:**  Generating two PWM signals that are inverses of each other. This is crucial for half-bridge and full-bridge topologies where one switch turns ON as the other turns OFF.\n    * **Dead-Time Insertion:**  Precisely controlling a \"dead-time\" period where both complementary PWM outputs are low. This prevents shoot-through currents in power switching applications by ensuring MOSFETs in a bridge configuration don't conduct simultaneously during switching transitions.\n    * **High-Frequency PWM:** STM32 MCUs, especially when running at higher clock speeds (e.g., 72MHz or more), can generate PWM signals in the kHz and even MHz ranges, suitable for various power electronic applications. The example in the DeepBlueEmbedded tutorial uses 20kHz, but higher frequencies are achievable by adjusting timer prescalers and auto-reload values.\n    * **Duty Cycle Modulation:**  The duty cycle of the PWM signals can be dynamically adjusted in software, allowing for control of power delivery or motor speed. This modulation can be achieved through direct register manipulation or using timer update events.\n    * **Configuration Simplicity:** Tools like STM32CubeMX significantly simplify the configuration of timers for complementary PWM and dead-time.  The graphical interface allows users to set parameters like PWM frequency, duty cycle, and dead-time, and then generate initialization code automatically.\n\n* **Implementation Steps (STM32 Example based on DeepBlueEmbedded Tutorial):**\n    1. **Hardware Setup:** Select an STM32 microcontroller with an advanced timer and identify the pins associated with the complementary PWM outputs (e.g., TIM1_CH1 and TIM1_CH1N).\n    2. **Software Configuration (STM32CubeMX):**\n        * Create a new project and select your STM32 target MCU.\n        * Configure the desired advanced timer (e.g., TIM1) to operate in \"Complementary PWM generation mode\" for the chosen channel (e.g., Channel 1).\n        * Set the PWM frequency by configuring the Prescaler (PSC) and Auto-Reload Register (ARR).  The tutorial provides the formula: `FPWM = FCLK / ((PSC+1) * (ARR+1))`.\n        * Set the desired duty cycle by configuring the \"Pulse\" value.  For a 50% duty cycle, set Pulse to approximately half of ARR.\n        * **Crucially, enable \"Complementary Output\" for the channel.**\n        * **Configure Dead-Time:**  Enable dead-time insertion and set the dead-time value.  The tutorial shows how to calculate the digital dead-time value based on the desired time and the timer clock frequency: `Dead Time (digital value) = Dead Time (time in seconds) * FCLK`.\n        * Configure the clock settings to achieve the desired system clock frequency (SysClk).\n        * Generate the project initialization code for your IDE (e.g., CubeIDE).\n    3. **Firmware Implementation:**\n        * Review the generated code, particularly the timer initialization section.\n        * Implement any necessary duty cycle modulation or control logic in your application code.\n        * Test the output signals using an oscilloscope to verify the frequency, duty cycle, complementarity, and dead-time.\n\n**2. Dedicated PWM Controller IC Solution (MAX5068 Example):**\n\n* **Dedicated PWM Controller ICs:** For applications demanding higher performance, higher frequencies, or specific features not readily available in general-purpose microcontrollers, dedicated PWM controller ICs are a viable alternative.  The MAX5068 is an example of a high-frequency, current-mode PWM controller.\n* **MAX5068 Features (based on datasheet snippet):**\n    * **High-Frequency Operation:** Designed for high-frequency PWM generation (potentially >500 kHz).\n    * **Programmable Oscillator:** Allows for precise setting of the PWM frequency.\n    * **Complementary Outputs:** Provides complementary PWM outputs, likely with built-in dead-time control (though not explicitly stated in the snippet, it's a common feature for such controllers).\n    * **Current-Mode Control:**  Indicates it's designed for power supply applications and likely includes features for current regulation.\n    * **Enable/Disable Inputs:**  Allows for external control of the PWM output.\n\n* **Considerations for Dedicated ICs:**\n    * **Specialized Functionality:**  Dedicated ICs are often optimized for specific applications (e.g., power conversion) and may offer features beyond basic PWM generation.\n    * **Component Count:**  Using a dedicated IC might reduce the software complexity compared to a microcontroller-based solution, but it adds an extra hardware component to the design.\n    * **Cost and Integration:**  Evaluate the cost and integration complexity compared to using an existing microcontroller if one is already present in the system.\n\n**Summary and Recommendation:**\n\nFor generating complementary PWM signals with dead-time, **STM32 microcontrollers with advanced timers offer a highly practical, flexible, and cost-effective solution for a wide range of applications.**  The availability of configuration tools like STM32CubeMX and extensive documentation makes implementation relatively straightforward.  This approach is well-suited for applications requiring modulation, control logic, and integration with other system functionalities, as all of this can be handled within the microcontroller.\n\nDedicated PWM controller ICs like the MAX5068 are more specialized and may be preferred for high-frequency, high-performance applications, or when a discrete hardware solution is desired.  However, for many embedded systems, the integrated microcontroller approach provides a balanced and efficient solution.\n\n**To provide a more tailored solution, please specify the following:**\n\n* **What is the target application for the complementary PWM signals?** (e.g., MOSFET gate driving, DC-DC converter, motor control, etc.)\n* **What is the desired PWM frequency?**\n* **What are the requirements for dead-time?**\n* **Do you need to modulate the PWM duty cycle?**\n* **Are there any other specific requirements or constraints?**\n\nWith more details about your specific needs, a more precise and optimized solution can be recommended.\n\nSources:\n- [STM32 Advanced Timers Part 1: Generating PWM and Complementary Output] (https://blog.embeddedexpert.io/?p=2055)\n- [STM32 Complementary PWM & Dead-Time (Code Examples)] (https://deepbluembedded.com/stm32-complementary-pwm-dead-time-code-examples/)\n- [MAX5068 Datasheet (PDF)] (https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX5068.pdf)"
