### **Recommended Solution: Texas Instruments LM5045 Full-Bridge PWM Controller**

The Texas Instruments LM5045 stands out as a strong candidate that directly addresses your requirements. It is a dedicated PWM controller IC designed for full-bridge power converters, inherently providing complementary outputs.

- **Complementary Outputs:** Designed for full-bridge topologies, the LM5045 provides four high-current (2A) gate drivers, which are used to drive the MOSFETs in a full-bridge configuration, naturally generating complementary PWM signals for each leg of the bridge.
- **Integrated Dead-Time Control:** The LM5045 features externally programmable leading and trailing edge dead-time adjustments. This allows you to precisely control the dead-time between the switching of complementary MOSFETs, crucial for efficiency and preventing shoot-through in bridge configurations.
- **Switching Frequency > 200kHz:** While the datasheet specifies a maximum operating frequency, full-bridge PWM controllers like the LM5045 are typically designed for high-frequency operation and can easily exceed 200kHz per output. Datasheet review is recommended to confirm the exact maximum and recommended operating frequency for your specific application.
- **Enable/Disable or Modulation Input:** The LM5045 includes a wide-bandwidth optocoupler interface. This interface can be utilized for various control functions, including enable/disable control and potentially for modulating the PWM output. You could implement a 20kHz modulation by controlling the enable pin with a 20kHz clock signal, effectively gating the PWM output at that frequency.
- **Plug-and-Play IC (Discrete Chip):** While not a module, the LM5045 is a highly integrated PWM controller IC. It's designed to be relatively "plug-and-play" in the sense that it integrates many necessary functions (gate drivers, dead-time control) into a single chip, reducing the need for extensive discrete circuitry for basic operation. It is readily available as a discrete IC for PCB integration.
- **Availability:** Texas Instruments products are widely distributed and generally readily available for purchase from major electronics distributors (e.g., Mouser, Digi-Key, Arrow, etc.).

### **Other Considerations and Less Suitable Options from Search Results**

- **Infineon AURIX Microcontroller (TOM/GTM Modules):**
  - The Infineon Developer Community discussion regarding AURIX microcontrollers highlights that while AURIX can generate complementary PWM with dead-time, it requires utilizing multiple modules (TOM and GTM/ARU) and configuring them to work together.
  - This approach is significantly more complex than using a dedicated PWM controller IC like the LM5045.
  - It is not a plug-and-play module and requires microcontroller programming expertise.
  - It's more of a microcontroller-based solution rather than a dedicated PWM controller IC.

- **General TI PWM Controller Overview:**
  - The TI PWM controller overview page provides a broad overview of TI's PWM controller offerings.
  - While it confirms TI's expertise in PWM controllers for high-frequency applications, it doesn't provide specific product recommendations beyond directing you to explore their product range.
  - It's a good starting point for browsing but less helpful for identifying a specific, readily available solution compared to the LM5045 product page.

### **Summary and Recommendation**

For your requirements of a commercially available, readily purchasable solution featuring complementary outputs, integrated dead-time, switching frequency exceeding 200kHz, and an enable/disable or modulation method, the **Texas Instruments LM5045 Full-Bridge PWM Controller IC** is the most suitable option identified from the provided search results. It is a dedicated IC designed for these functionalities and is likely to be more plug-and-play compared to microcontroller-based PWM generation methods.

While plug-and-play *modules* are preferred, dedicated PWM controller ICs like the LM5045 offer a high level of integration and are often the most efficient and compact solution for high-frequency power conversion applications. You would need to integrate the IC onto a PCB, but the integrated features minimize the need for external components for basic operation.

### **Further Steps**

1. **Review the LM5045 Datasheet:** Download and thoroughly review the LM5045 datasheet from the TI website to confirm all specifications meet your exact application needs, especially regarding switching frequency, dead-time range, and control interface capabilities.
2. **Check Availability and Pricing:** Check the availability and pricing of the LM5045 from major electronic component distributors.
3. **Consider Evaluation Boards (if available):** Texas Instruments and distributors sometimes offer evaluation boards for their ICs. Check if an evaluation board is available for the LM5045. This could significantly simplify initial testing and prototyping.
